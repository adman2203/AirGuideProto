swift app prototype for ENGR408

Hard coded prototype swift app for my ENGR408 final group project
Idea is a google maps/waze-esque app where you can find routes between terminals at a selected airport or find your way to the exit. 
Used PIT airport as an example since it's simple and most local to me, but ideally this would be nice to have in more large or convoluted airports.
